## App Goal

Learn about asynchronous programming in Dart and use device location and networking to get data from the internet. 


## What's new in this app 

Make a weather app inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Olia Gozha](https://dribbble.com/shots/4663154-) in which we will be able to find out the live weather data in the current location of the device as well as the weather for any city you can think of!
